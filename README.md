# NFT Marketplace Smart Contracts

This repository contains the Solidity smart contracts for the NFT Marketplace, developed using the Hardhat framework. These contracts handle the core functionalities of the NFT marketplace, including minting, trading, and managing NFT ownership on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 🚀 Features

- **Minting NFTs**: Allows users to mint unique NFTs with customizable metadata.
- **Buying and Selling**: Facilitates peer-to-peer trading of NFTs on the marketplace.
- **Auction System**: Supports timed auctions where users can place bids on NFTs.
- **Royalties**: Automatically distribute royalties to original creators on each sale.
- **Secure Transactions**: Transactions are secured through smart contracts with no intermediaries.
- **Ownership Transfer**: NFTs can be transferred securely and transparently on-chain.
- **Admin Privileges**: Admins can verify or remove fraudulent NFTs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: The main programming language for writing Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment and testing framework for Ethereum.
- **Ethers.js**: Used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain in tests and deployment.
- **OpenZeppelin**: Standardized smart contracts for security and best practices.
- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage for NFT metadata and assets.
- **Hardhat-deploy**: Plugin for managing deployment scripts.
